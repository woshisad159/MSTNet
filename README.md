# MSTNet
This repo holds codes of the paper: Multi-scale temporal network for continuous sign language recognition. [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03864.pdf)

---
### Notice

- This project is implemented in Pytorch (1.11.0+cu113). Thus please install Pytorch first.

- ctcdecode==0.4 [[parlance/ctcdecode]](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode)ï¼Œfor beam search decode.

- This project runs in pycharm, so you need to install pycharm

- The SLR is the main function.

### Data Preparation

1. Download the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 Dataset [[download link]](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX/).

2. After finishing dataset download, extract it.
